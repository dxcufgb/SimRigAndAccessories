        <h1 id="wires-lots-of-wires">Wires… LOTS of wires…</h1>
<p>This space will be dedicated to my attempts at wiring components together to what will, hopefully, become an assembly of neat little boxes housing the actual components.</p>

<h1 id="1-diy-usb-on-off-switch">1. DIY USB on-off switch</h1>

<p>This was an idea I had that I wanted to be able to turn the data stream for the dashboard components on and of with the flip of, an actual, switch!</p>

<p>After some, not so very extensive, research I found that it would be quite a simple task!
Just cut open a USB cable, cut the red wire and attach a switch in between the ends…</p>

<p>IT WAS NOT SIMPLE!</p>

<p>The wires in the USB cable were so tiny i could not find an actual tool that would remove the isolation and exposing the wire without damaging the wire.</p>

<p>So i opted for a different solution where i bought two small PCBs with attached USB-sockets!
One with a micro-USB socket and one with a regular USB-A socket.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to try and solder theese together using AWG22 wires.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction page, I have NEVER soldered ANYTHING before I started this project.</p>
