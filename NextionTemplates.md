# 1. Subaru WRX STI S207
This was my first (complete) attempt at a dashboard.
the dashboard is mainly adjusted to work with Forza Motorsport 7 (FM7) and might therefore need a little tweaking to work with other games.

Since it's based on a street car dashboard there's not really a lot of values being presented except speed, rpm, boost(since I couldn't find current consumption rate for FM7) current and total laps, position and ODO.

Some samples:
