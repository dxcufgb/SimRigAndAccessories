# Wires... LOTS of wires...
This space will be dedicated to my attempts at wiring components together to what will, hopefully, become an assembly of neat little boxes housing the actual components.

# 1. DIY USB on-off switch

This was an idea I had that I wanted to be able to turn the data stream for the dashboard components on and of with the flip of, an actual, switch!

After some, not so very extensive, research I found that it would be quite a simple task!
Just cut open a USB cable, cut the red wire and attach a switch in between the ends...

IT WAS NOT SIMPLE!

The wires in the USB cable were so tiny i could not find an actual tool that would remove the isolation and exposing the wire without damaging the wire.

So i opted for a different solution where i bought two small PCBs with attached USB-sockets!
One with a micro-USB socket and one with a regular USB-A socket.

I then proceeded to try and solder theese together using AWG22 wires.

As mentioned in the introduction page, I have NEVER soldered ANYTHING before I started this project.
