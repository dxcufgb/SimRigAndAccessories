Welcome to SimRigAndAccessories!

This all started when I found myself in need of a gear indicator while playing the newly released DiRT 2.0 and always seemed to have the wrong gear out of the hairpins.

Then it sort of got a little bit bigger When I found [Simhub](http://www.simhubdash.com/) and found out all the stuff they where compatible with.

this is MAINLY here for me to be able to write and share my ideas and progress on my racing game rig and dashboard attachments!

Since I'm new to almost everything except basic carpenting and programming this will be a journey where (hopefully) I will develop new skillsets and learn a lot of new things.

I will upload stuff I make and add links to other peoples work that I use or got inspired from. I make all of this as a "learning-by-doing", or "trying" in my case, where the end goal is to build a complete racing rig, one step at a time.

Since I live in Sweden and I started this project in mid February, I could not start with the actual build before spring arrived so that I could do the woodworking and such outside. so I started tinkering with the dashboard part instead.
